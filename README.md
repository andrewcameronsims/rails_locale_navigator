# Locale Navigator

This VSCode extension adds a command which allows you to quickly switch between code and translation files in Ruby on Rails.

This allows you to create translations in any of the locales supported by I18n. You will be asked which locale you intend when you run the command.

If no locale file exists for the code it will create it and stub out the initial `.yml` that is necessary for the file.

## To use

Use `cmd + shift + l` on MacOS or `ctrl + shift + l` on Windows.
